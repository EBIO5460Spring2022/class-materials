* What is machine learning?
* An outline of algorithms for prediction
* Predictive accuracy and the bias-variance tradeoff
* Inference algorithm: cross validation
* Model algorithm: smoothers
* Training algorithm (optimizer + cost function)

## Weeks 3-4
* Regularization and penalized optimization
* Decision tree models (regression, classification)
* Ensemble algorithms: stacking, bagging, random forests, boosting

## Weeks 5-6

* Neural network models and deep learning
* Stochastic gradient descent and back propagation
* Neural network model architectures for different problems
* Training strategies for deep learning

## Week 7-10
