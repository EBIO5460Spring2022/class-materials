### Week 4 homework

Since we missed a class this week due to the snowstorm, we're a bit behind on needed content for homework, so the bulk of this past week's topics will come after Monday's class.

#### 1. Coding: classification trees

The goal of this homework is to compare the predictive performance (using k-fold CV) of decision-tree models to the KNN model from the previous homework for the presence/absence of the Willow Tit. Start with a simple classification tree (use the `tree()` function from the `class` package. After Monday, also consider a bagged classification tree and a random forest model.
