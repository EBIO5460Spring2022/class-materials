This week we transition to the reading and project phase of the semester. There are three immediate tasks associated with this transition:

1) Read papers for this week: [09_1_reading.md](09_1_reading.md)
2) Select a paper to lead a discussion in the following weeks: [09_3_lead_a_discussion.md](09_3_lead_a_discussion.md)
3) We'll talk about this in more detail next week but in the meantime start thinking about your individual project. Do you want to do a coding project or a literature-based project or a bit of each? You can design your own project.
