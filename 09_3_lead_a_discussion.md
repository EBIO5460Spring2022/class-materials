# Select a paper to lead a discussion

Due Wed 9 Mar

I have curated a selection of papers in a zotero group library. The papers include case studies and reviews:

* https://www.zotero.org/groups/4619195/machine_learning_ecology_2022/library
* I will send an invitation to join the group

Beginning in week 10, you'll each present on and lead discussion for one paper but I'll try to balance the overall selection of papers. I propose that you each pick 4 papers and rank them in order of your preference from 1 to 4. I'll then consider those lists as both a class vote on which papers to read and personal preference for which to lead and I'll assign people to papers, with a coin toss if necessary to break ties.

Within the case studies, I have presorted the papers according to a star rating. Use the star-rating in the tags panel (bottom left) to select papers from 5-star (highest) to 2-star (lowest). For example, click on 5-star to see all the highest rated papers. These are not exactly quality ratings of papers but suggested priorities for reading and discussion given the objectives of the class. I felt the papers in 5 stars would make excellent case studies followed by those in 4 stars etc. The papers in 3-star and 2-star are increasingly niche topics but you could choose any of the papers from throughout this collection if they match your interest.

You may add new potential papers to this library but please add them to the "new" folder only. You can include new papers among the 4 papers you pick but it must be a case study, not a review.
