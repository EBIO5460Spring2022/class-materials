This is the second semester in a graduate-level "data science for ecology" sequence. Semester 1 is [here](https://github.com/EBIO5460Fall2021/class-materials).

The repository includes lecture slides (pdf) and code. For the most part, where code is concerned you want to view the `.md` files in your web browser from GitHub. These are knitted from the R code. You can also run the R code on your computer from the `.R` files.
