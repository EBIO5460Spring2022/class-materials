#### Think about your individual project

You can choose either a **coding project** or a **literature review project** or a combination. 

* A coding project could either be with your own data or it could be using data from a paper. 
* Replications or improvements to existing papers are a possibility. 

The Zotero library collection is a useful inspiration for individual projects. Apart from the case studies, the collection of review papers is full of ideas (use the "review" tag to select all the reviews).

Scope: something you can do in about 4 weeks.

Products: Presentation 30 mins in the last week of class. Submitted code or essay/review.
