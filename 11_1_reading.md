#### Discussion papers for week 11

You need to read the paper plus submit a small written reflection (except for the discussion leader). The reflection should be **pushed to github before class**.  You won't get credit for the discussion unless you push to github before class. The reflection should include your thoughts on each of the questions under "questions to consider" below. It can be very brief and in bullet-point form but feel free to expand if you prefer.



**Monday**

* Leader: Michael
* Bravata N, Kelly D, Eickholt J, et al (2020). Applications of deep convolutional neural networks to predict length, circumference, and weight from mostly dewatered images of fish. *Ecology and Evolution* 10:9313–9325. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6618.



**Wednesday**

* Leader: Airy
* Gray PC, Fleishman AB, Klein DJ, et al (2019). A convolutional neural network for detecting sea turtles in drone imagery. *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* 10:345–355. https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13132.



**Questions to consider for both papers**

  * What is the general prediction goal of the model(s) in this paper?
  * Describe the response variable
  * Describe the predictor variables and any feature engineering
  * What are the training and test data?
  * Describe the machine learning method(s) used (e.g. architecture of NN).
  * How did they train, tune, and evaluate the model?
  * Is this an approach that wouldn't be possible without machine learning and how was it advantageous to use this specific machine learning method?
  * Do you have any critiques of the paper, either methodological or about the conclusions drawn?
  * 2-3 other bullet points, which might be insights or questions you want to raise in the discussion



**Discussion leaders**

Everybody will consider the questions above for each paper. The discussion leader will in addition prepare a presentation (e.g. powerpoint, google slides, beamer) that answers each of the **first six** questions (the what and how). The leader should go into a little bit of detail for each question (e.g. one slide per question; no more than two slides) highlighting especially any method details we haven't already covered in the first part of the course.  The overview presentation will be about 15-20 minutes. The discussion leader should also think of 2-3 key questions to ask of the group as discussion points. The discussion leader doesn't need to submit a written reflection but should submit their presentation.
