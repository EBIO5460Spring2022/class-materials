#### Discussion paper for week 15

This week, you don't need to submit a reflection for the paper. I have chosen a paper that highlights an approach that blends machine learning and theory-based models. Also it's written by EBIO alumnus Max Joseph!



**Monday**

* One-on-one meetings for individual projects. Schedule will be emailed.



**Wednesday**

* Joseph MB (2020). Neural hierarchical models of ecological populations. *Ecology Letters* 23:734â€“747. https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13462.



**Questions to consider for the paper**

  * How can ecological theory and machine learning be integrated?
