#### Individual project outline

1. A brief statement of the prediction problem. What is the general prediction goal?
  2. Describe the response variable in some detail. How were the data collected? What is the size of the dataset? Comment on data quality, etc
  3. Describe the predictor variables and any planned feature engineering (data transformation etc)
  4. Describe the machine learning method(s) you intend to use (e.g. methods to compare such as random forests vs xgboost, ideas for the architecture of NN, etc).
  7. How do you plan to train, tune, and evaluate the model? (e.g. How will you divide the data into training, validation, and/or test sets? What parameters will you tune? What loss or error function will you use to measure predictive performance?)

Recall that the scope of the project is something you can do in about 4 weeks. The project will culminate in a 30 min presentation in the last week of class and submitted code.
