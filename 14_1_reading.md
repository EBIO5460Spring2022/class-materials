#### Discussion paper for week 14

You need to read the paper plus submit a small written reflection. The reflection should be **pushed to github before class**.  You won't get credit for the discussion unless you push to github before class. The reflection should include your thoughts on each of the questions under "questions to consider" below. It can be very brief and in bullet-point form but feel free to expand if you prefer.



**Monday**

* Open discussion of individual projects



**Wednesday**

* Norouzzadeh MS, Nguyen A, Kosmala M, et al (2018). Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 115:E5716â€“E5725. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1719367115.



**Questions to consider for the paper**

  * What is the general prediction goal of the model(s) in this paper?
  * Describe the response variable
  * Describe the predictor variables and any feature engineering
  * What are the training and test data?
  * Describe the machine learning method(s) used (e.g. architecture of NN).
  * How did they train, tune, and evaluate the model?
  * Is this an approach that wouldn't be possible without machine learning and how was it advantageous to use this specific machine learning method?
  * Do you have any critiques of the paper, either methodological or about the conclusions drawn?
  * 2-3 other bullet points, which might be insights or questions you want to raise in the discussion
